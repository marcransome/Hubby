# Hubby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcransome/Hubby.png)](https://travis-ci.org/marcransome/Hubby)
Hubby lives in your menu bar and makes it easy for you to take control of your GitHub repositories.  Hubby can also notify you when the little fix-it elves at [GitHub](https://www.github.com) are busy fixing something that has [broken](https://status.github.com/).  Be it a major meltdown or a minor hiccup, Hubby will politely inform you that Something-Is-Going-Onâ„¢.  Hubby won't make the world a better place, but it will keep you in the know.
