##Hubby
Hubby lives in your menu bar and notifies you when the little fix-it elves at [GitHub](https://www.github.com) are busy fixing something that [broke](https://status.github.com/).  Be it a major meltdown, or a minor hiccup, Hubby will politely inform you that Something-Is-Going-Onâ„¢.  Hubby won't make the world a better place, but it will keep you in the know.
